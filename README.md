The changes that we made to this page include but are not limited to:

1. Changing the elements of the HTML file so that they meet the accessibility standards and that they follow the semantic HTML format.

2. Adding alt tags to the images so that there is a description of the image if the image fails to load.

3. Consolidating the style.css file so that there isn't repeat code written.

4. Ensuring that any syntax errors were removed.
